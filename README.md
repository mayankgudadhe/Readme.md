- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for cloud resource management.
- **Docker & Kubernetes (K8s)**: Containerization and container orchestration for scalable application deployment.

### DevOps & CI/CD
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and collaboration.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automating workflows, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment processes.
- **Jenkins**: Continuous integration for building, testing, and deploying applications.
- **Maven**: Project management and build automation tool for Java projects.
- **Ansible**: Automating configuration management and deployment processes.

### Programming Languages
- **Python**: Scripting, automation, and data engineering.
- **Shell Scripting**: Linux automation and server management.
- **Java**: For backend development and web applications.
- **JavaScript**: For front-end development (Node.js, React).

### Web & App Servers
- **Apache Tomcat**: Java-based web application server.
- **Nginx**: Reverse proxy, load balancer, and web server.

### Methodologies & Practices
- **Agile**: Scrum, Kanban, and iterative development.
- **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment for automated and reliable software delivery.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Managing infrastructure through code to improve reliability and scalability.

## üöÄ What I Do

As a **DevOps Engineer**, my primary goal is to ensure that the development lifecycle is automated, efficient, and reliable. I work to integrate **cloud solutions**, **CI/CD pipelines**, and **containerization** strategies to build scalable, secure, and maintainable applications. I help organizations automate manual processes, minimize downtime, and streamline operations.

### My Expertise Includes:
- Designing and deploying scalable cloud infrastructure on **AWS**.
- Building and managing containerized applications using **Docker** and **Kubernetes**.
- Automating **CI/CD pipelines** with **GitHub Actions**, **Jenkins**, and **Maven**.
- Infrastructure automation with **Ansible** to improve efficiency and reduce manual intervention.
- Collaborating with teams to follow **Agile** methodologies for faster and adaptive development cycles.

## üå± Currently Learning & Exploring

- **AWS Advanced Networking**: Improving my skills in advanced cloud networking and security.
- **Kubernetes Operators**: Deep diving into Kubernetes Operators to manage complex workloads.
- **Cloud Security**: Focusing on securing cloud infrastructures and applications.
